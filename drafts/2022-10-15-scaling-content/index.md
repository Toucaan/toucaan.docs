Toucaan utilizes an intrinsically scaling type system instead of a formulaic one or the one that is limited by container queries.

# So what is Intrinsic Scaling?

Since intrinsic broadly implies _belonging to the device_, it is only fair to assume that the contents–meaning, the text, the inline images, the embeds or just anything that makes up the "contents"–will scale correctly to belong to the device. 


We already know [the device a user is on](https://www.toucaan.com/blog/a-css-router). All we have to do now is make sure the content is correctly adapted to the medium.

### Mathematics

A mathematically grounded and block-scoped type scaling system.
