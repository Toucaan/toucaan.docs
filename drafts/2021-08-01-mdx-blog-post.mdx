<summary>Why is it called swizzling?</summary>

**The name comes from Objective-C and Swift-UI**: [method swizzling](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2019/swizzling-in-swift/) is the process of changing the implementation of an existing selector (method).

**For Docusaurus, component swizzling means providing an alternative component that takes precedence over the component provided by the theme.**

You can think of it as [Monkey Patching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch) for React components, enabling you to override the default implementation. Gatsby has a similar concept called [theme shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/shadowing/).

To gain a deeper understanding of this, you have to understand [how theme components are resolved](./advanced/client.md#theme-aliases).
