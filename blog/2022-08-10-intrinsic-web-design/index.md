Welcome to the [Toucaan Blog](https://toucaan.com/blog)â€”the home of **modern intrinsic design** for mobile apps and the web. 

Toucaan is a new approach to web and mobile application design that snuck out of the bag while we were working on [Bubblin](https://bubblin.io) & [Red Goose](https://goose.red). The framework is robust yet straightforward in implementation. It offers granular control and maintainability at scale and allows a developer to create meaningful interfaces that bank on the **intrinsic capabilities** of the medium. 

Toucaan has been in production at the [Red Goose](https://goose.red) for the past three months.

### What is Intrinsic Design?

Intrinsic in the context of application design implies _belonging_ to a device. This term was coined by the one and only Jenn Simmons while working on flex and grid-based layouts at Mozilla, but the curious mind could easily hop layouts and explore (1) what _belongs_ and what doesn't on a given medium for the rest of the design vocabulary and (2) determine what [devices are on the web today](https://bubblin.io/blog/the-new-landscape-of-the-web) other than just mobile and desktop. 

Toucaan outshines the older traditional css frameworks on the following fronts at least:

- Complete separation of device-specific design language without using hardcoded MQ breakpoints in pixel width. Toucaan uses a [css router](https://bubblin.io/blog/a-css-router) instead.
- An intrinsically scaling mathematically grounded system of typography scoped to a component or block.
- Avoid the use of a heavy `reset` or `normalize` and replace it with a lighter and more strategic [baseline](https://bubblin.io/blog/baseline-css)
- Support new devices on the web like the Apple Watch, EVs like the Tesla Model S and Tesla Model 3, bendable or foldable smartphones and tablets, projectors, and TVs.

And many more, but the list isn't complete or discovered fully yet. We wish to invite you to take Toucaan out for a spin. Share your ideas and feedback on how to approach intrinsicality in the art of interfaces and application design, and standardize it. 

We would love to see your ideas included in the core framework. Contributions are welcome.
