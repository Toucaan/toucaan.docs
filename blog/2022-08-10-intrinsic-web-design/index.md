Welcome to the [Toucaan Blog](https://toucaan.com/blog). This is a collection of articles and tutorials on the [Toucaan](https://toucaan.com) project.

Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `blog` directory.

Regular blog authors can be added to `authors.yml`.

The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:

- `2019-05-30-welcome.md`
- `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`

A blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images:

![Total Ban Toucaan](./toucaan-total-banner.jpg)

The blog supports tags as well!

**And if you don't want a blog**: just delete this directory, and use `blog: false` in your Toucaan config.
