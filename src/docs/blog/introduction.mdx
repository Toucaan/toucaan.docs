# Introduction

Toucaan design system.

## Principles

You have many options available when you want to create your own design system or even just document your project. Looking over these alternatives, we borrowed the best ideas from each and came up with these principles:

- **Zero config and easy to learn.** No unnecessary build steps with confusing setups.
- **Blazing fast.** Built with performance in mind from the start.
- **Easy to customize.** Create something that will be easy to use and customize.
- **MDX based.** The best standard for writing documentation.
- **Pluggable.** Plugins are the best choice when you need a custom and flexible solution.

Now you know the core principles of Toucaan. Let's [get started](/docs/getting-started)!
