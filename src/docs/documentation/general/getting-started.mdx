# Getting Started

It is very easy to start using Toucaan on a new project.

## New Project

The first step is to create a new directory called `toucaan` inside your project.
This folder would contain all of the CSS of your app:

```bash

  $ cd /inside/your/project && mkdir toucaan.

```

Paste the following `style` tag in the `<head></head>` section of your application layout to quickly get started:

```
<style>
  /* Portrait â‡‹ landscape switch. */
  @import url('./public/dist/portrait.css') only screen and (orientation: portrait);
  @import url('./public/dist/landscape.css') only screen and (orientation: landscape);

  /* --bu stands for base unit of blockscoped typography. */
  @media only screen and (orientation: portrait) {
    :root {
      --bu: calc(100vw/100); /* Fallback if vmin is not supported. */
    }
  }
  @media only screen and (orientation: landscape) {
    :root {
      --bu: calc(100vh/100); /* Fallback if vmin is not supported. */
    }
  }
  /* Global variables below */
  :root {
    --bu: 1vmin;
    /* all variables here */
  }
</style>
```



## Start on an Existing Project

On older projects, the transition to Toucaan can be slightly tricky.

Remove all style inclusions like `<link rel="stylesheet" media="all" href="/path/to/bootstrap.css">` from your HTML.
