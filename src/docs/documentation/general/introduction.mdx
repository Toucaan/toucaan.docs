# Introduction

Fourteen years ago Yahoo! came up with one of the first CSS reset called the [YUI](https://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/02/13/the-yahoo-user-interface-library/)
that was adopted widely across the web. The YUI was a critical milestone in the
history of "web design" that helped us achieve consistent style on the web. Since the days
of the YUI, new CSS frameworks and design systems have sprung up that
make our lives as web developers easier, and even now, the tooling continues to
[evolve](https://bubblin.io/blog/toucaan-introduction).

There is a Cambrian explosion of devices with a modern browser connected to the Internet
today and the web is already much [bigger and wider](https://bubblin.io/blog/toucaan-introduction) than ever before.

There is the Apple Watch Series 5 with a trusty webkit, a self-driving Tesla car with a
V9 web browser, foldable smartphones, foldable tablets, and even the iPads and the good
old desktops and laptops continue to add more pixels and inches to the screen.

## Intrinsic Web Design

Point here is that responsive design or what we have come to call "mobile-first" approach with a few hardcoded
break points on CSS isn't enough anymore. We need a new approach that is both smart and **intrinsic**
to the diversity of devices on the web today. Rethink our ways of thinking up web-design according
to the new canvas that we are at in 2020 and beyond.

[Toucaan](https://toucaan.com) is free and open source **mutative** design system based
on CSS Grids.

Create intrinsic layouts that "belong to" the target devices easily!


## Principles

You have many options available when you want to create your own design system. Toucaan goes after the following ideals that we borrowed from the best resources on the open web today. Surely, these aren't the end all or be all of it and we will happily accept new insights as PRs on Github:

- **Mathematically grounded.** Solid and scalable 'utility driven' design strategy.
- **Semantic layouts.** Say hello to CSS grids with meaningful layouts.
- **Blockscoped typography.** Smart text scaling with element level scope.
- **Easy to customize.** Pixel-perfect designs that are easy to maintain and reason about.
- **Pluggable & themable.** Plugins and starter themes are the best. Use what you need.

Now you know the core principles of Toucaan. Let's [get started](/docs/getting-started)!
