# Introduction

Fifteen years ago, Yahoo! came up with one of the first CSS resets called the [YUI](https://clarle.github.io/yui3/).
It was the first reset that was adopted widely and shaped our early concept of "web design."
In those days the Internet Explorer used to rule the web and Firefox was catching up!

Looking back, in many ways YUI was to CSS what jQuery was to JavaScript.

A critical step in the founding of the UX/UI industry.

## Deprecating Normalization

Over the years several normalization techniques have been surfaced by the developer community.
Some more prominent than others.
And with each passing upgrade, we have hopefully managed to deliver a better web-experience to the end-user than before.

Occasionally, we have also made our lives as web developers easier.

And yet in all that hustle and growth of the CSS ecosystem, the underlying principle in each of these passing reboots has remained the same over the years:

Achieving [cross-browser consistency](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/04/18/reset-reasoning/).

CSS engineers have always sought after providing a uniform set of default styles across the spectrum of vendors.
While this was a solid goal back in the day, it has become less of an issue on date.
Even when there is a Cambrian explosion of new devices with a modern browser connected to the Internet, the default web has advanced to a point where a heavy-handed reset or deep normalization is no longer required.

Consistency is more-or-less a given.

## Intrinsic Web Design

We probably need to step back a little and look at the new powers of CSS instead.
Houdini, CSS TOM api come to mind but there are numerous other new CSS properties that enable fine control over aspects of the web that weren't available earlier.


It is clear that the web, which was already big, is even [bigger](https://bubblin.io/blog/the-new-landscape-of-the-web) now.

There is an Apple Watch with a trusty `webkit` browser, a self-driving Tesla car with a V9 web-browser, a foldable smartphone, a foldable tablet, and even the desktops continue to add more pixels-per-inch (ppi/dpi) with each new release.

It is clear that responsive web design or what we call the "mobile-first" technique will no longer scale to support the new type of devices that are on the web.
Take the example of an Apple Watch perhapsâ€“a sub-inch viewport where [pixels do not scale]() correctly.

Think about viewability of content on a web-browser in a moving car like Tesla which will pose new challenges!
We need a new approach that is both smart and **intrinsic** to the nature of web today.

And stop going after goals of the past that are no longer valid.

## App-like Interfaces

[Toucaan](https://toucaan.com) is free and open source **mutative** design system that puts intrinsicality of design front and center.
It puts web-design and app-design closer together in a bid to design a common language for interfaces that simply "belong to" the device.

## Framework ideals

Toucaan adopts the following design ideals that we have borrowed from some of the best resources available on the Internet:

- **Semantic layouts.** Say hello to meaningful layouts with CSS grids.
- **Blockscoped typography.** Smart subpixel class text-scaling at element level.
- **Mathematically grounded.** A solid design strategy grounded in maths.
- **Easy to customize.** Pixel-perfect designs that are easy to maintain and reason about.
- **Mutable & themable.** Allows for in-place theme-ing and framework mutations.

Use what you need, however you need.
