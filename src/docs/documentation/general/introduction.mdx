# Introduction

Fourteen years ago `Yahoo!` came out with one of the first [CSS reset](https://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/02/13/the-yahoo-user-interface-library/) (YUI) for consistent styling on the web.
Since that first major reset, CSS frameworks have improved a lot and continue to evolve to make our life as a developer easier. In fact, the web itself has evolved considerably since there is now a Cambrian explosion of devices connected to the web today. 

To sum it up, web is already much [bigger and wider](https://bubblin.io/blog/toucaan-introduction) than just a few smartphones and desktops. There is the webkit renderer on the Apple Watch 5, V9 web browser on Tesla cars, foldable smartphones and tablets with an adaptive browser from the likes of Samsung and Microsoft, and even the iPads and the good old desktops continue to add more pixels and inches to the screen. 


Point being responsive web design or what we call "mobile-first with a few break points on CSS" isn't going to be enough anymore. We need a new approach that is smart and **intrinsic** to the vastness of the web today. Adapt our ways of thinking web-design according to the new canvas we are at. Ala, meet Toucaanâ€”.



## Principles

You have many options available when you want to create your own design system. Toucaan goes after the following ideas that we borrowed from the best resources on the open web today. Surely, these aren't the end all or be all of what Toucaan stands for and we will happily accept new insights and ideas as PRs on Github:

- **Mathematically grounded.** Introduces a solid and scalable 'utility driven' design strategy.
- **Semantic layouts.** Semantics are important. Say hello to CSS grids for layouts!
- **Blockscoped typography.** The best standard for writing documentation.
- **Easy to customize.** Create designs that are easy to read and dabble with.
- **Pluggable & themable.** Plugins and starter themes are the best! Use only what you need.

Now you know the core principles of Toucaan. Let's [get started](/docs/getting-started)!
