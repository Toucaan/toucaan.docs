# Introduction

Fifteen years ago, Yahoo! came up with one of the first CSS resets called the [YUI](https://clarle.github.io/yui3/). 

In those days the Internet Explorer ruled the web and Firefox was only catching up from the sidelines. 
It was the YUI that was adopted widely and shaped our initial concept of web-design. YUI was to CSS what jQuery was to JavaScript. 

A critical step in the founding of the subject of web-design itself. 

## Deprecating Normalization

Over the years several new normalization techniques have been surfaced by the community, with each passing upgrade promising to deliver a better web experience and making our lives as web developers easier. 

And yet the underlying principle in each of these reboots has remained the same: [Browser consistency](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2007/04/18/reset-reasoning/).

Today, there is a Cambrian explosion of devices with a modern browser connected to the Internet.
The web which was already big back then, is much [bigger and wider](https://bubblin.io/blog/the-new-landscape-of-the-web) now.
There is an Apple Watch with a trusty webkit browser, a self-driving Tesla car with a V9 web-browser, a foldable smartphone, a foldable tablet, and even the desktops continue to add more pixels-per-inch (ppi/dpi) with each new release.


Web has advanced to a point where a heavy-handed reset or deep normalization is no longer required. Consistency, which had been a goal of resets for more than a decade, is a given now.
We need to step back and look at the pursuit of consistency itself. 

Arrive arrive a fundamentally [new type of baseline](https://bubblin.io/blog/baseline-css) that is enough for modern web-design.


## Intrinsic Web Design

Responsive web design or what we call the "mobile-first" technique is somewhat limited when it comes to supporting new type of devices on the web. 
An Apple Watch, for example, is a sub-inch viewport whereas the accessibility of a web-browser in a moving car like Tesla has its own challenges. 

We need a new approach that is both smart and **intrinsic** to the nature of device in question. 
Revisit our ways of wiring up UX/UI according to the canvas of the new web.

[Toucaan](https://toucaan.com) is free and open source **mutative** design system that puts intrinsicality of design front and center.
It treats web-design and app-design closer together as a common ground for interfaces that belong to the physical boundary of the surface under interaction. 

## Principles of App-like Interfaces

There are so many options to choose from when starting a new project. Toucaan goes after the following design ideals that we borrowed from some of the best resources available on the Internet today:

- **Mathematically grounded.** Solid and scalable 'utility driven' intrinsic design strategy.
- **Semantic layouts.** Say hello to meaningful layouts with CSS grids.
- **Blockscoped typography.** Smart text scaling with element level scope.
- **Easy to customize.** Pixel-perfect designs that are easy to maintain and reason about.
- **Pluggable & themable.** Plugins and starter themes are the best. Use what you need.
