# Usability in a moving vehicle 

Electric Vehicles like the Tesla Model 3 are the latest web devices you could design your apps for. The accessibility context of a moving vehicle is very different from the accessibility context of desktop sitting on a table. There are both safety and accessibility concerns when designing an application for use/interaction during a drive. 

Here are a few things to keep in mind while designing for users behind the wheel:


### 1. Attention Span
Almost 100% of their attention is towards driving safely and adapting to ever changing road conditions. Whatever your app does, it must be quick, direct, simple, and easy to quit.

### 2. Main Functionality
Keep your app's main functionality and the exit buttons above-the-fold at all times, and preferably near the upper edge of the bezel or the center of the screen.

### 3. Oversized Elements
Use oversized responsive buttons with large labels for ease of input inside a moving and shaking car. This will help reduce the number of missed taps by a human finger.

### 4. Restrained Interaction
Assume that the user is restrained by a seat-belt and their access to the screen is somewhat limited by the belt than otherwise. 

### 5. Distance of operation
A user that is fastened by a seat-belt may be held at twice the distance away from the screen than normal circumstances.
