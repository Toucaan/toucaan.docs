# Getting Started

The first step is to add Toucaan to your project. 



```bash title="./your/project/root/:"
git submodule add https://github.com/Toucaan/toucaan
```

The command above will add Toucaan to your project like a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). Please commit the `.gitmodules` file to your repository along with the framework code.

Now you can start **implementing your app's multiple frontends** with Toucaan. 

Go to the next step and [install](./installation.md) a `sass` preprocessor.

Recommended to review the [Architecture of Toucaan](core-concepts/architecture). The core concepts are important!

:::note
This is an early version of Toucaan (< 1.0.0). Our documentation and tooling is in the state of flux and you're likely to encounter a few breaking changes in the next few weeks.
