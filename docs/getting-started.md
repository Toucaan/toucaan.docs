# Getting Started

### Installation

Add Toucaan to your project, like so: 



```bash title="in/your/project/at/root/"
git submodule add https://github.com/Toucaan/toucaan
```

The command above will install Toucaan to your project like a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)[^1]. That's it.
Now you can start **implementing your application's multiple frontends** with Toucaan.

Go to the next step and [set up](./preprocessor) the `sass` preprocessor.
