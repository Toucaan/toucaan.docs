# Getting Started

The first step is to add Toucaan to your project. At the root:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/Toucaan/toucaan
```

The command above will add Toucaan to your project like a `git submodule`. That's it! Now you can start styling your app's multiple frontends with Toucaan. 

Go to next step and [install](./installation.md) a `sass` preprocessor.
