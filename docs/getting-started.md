# Getting Started

### Installation

Add Toucaan to your project, like so: 



```bash title="in/your/project/at/root/"
git submodule add https://github.com/Toucaan/toucaan
```

The command above will install Toucaan to your project like a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)[^1]. That's it.
Now you can start **implementing your application's multiple frontends** with Toucaan.

Go to the [next step](./preprocessor) and set up the preprocessor.

---

Not using git? Set up Toucaan manually (DIY) in just a [few commands](./core-concepts/diy.md) and use any version control you like.

:::tip 
Review the [Architecture of Toucaan](core-concepts/architecture) and glance through the core concepts quickly.

:::info Inline Documentation
Toucaan's [sourcecode](https://github.com/Toucaan/toucaan) is also documented in-line. Contributions and improvements are very welcome.

:::caution
This is an early version of Toucaan (< 1.0.0). Our documentation and tooling is in the state of flux and you're likely to encounter a few breaking changes in the next few weeks.
