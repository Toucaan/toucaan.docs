# Getting Started

### Installation

Add Toucaan to your project, like so:

```bash title="at/your/project/root/"
git submodule add https://github.com/Toucaan/toucaan
```

The command above will install Toucaan to your project like a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)[^1]. That's it. Now you can start **implementing your application's multiple frontends** with Toucaan.

Go to the [next step](./configuration) and configure your HTML to start using Toucaan.

---

Not using git? Set up Toucaan manually (DIY) with just a [few commands](./core-concepts/diy.md) and use it with any version control system you like.

:::tip
