# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **Toucaan in a few minutes**.

## Getting Started

**Create a new folder `toucaan`** in your project as follows. Run the following command:

```bash
mkdir -p toucaan/{accessibility,app/{desktop,mobile,tablet,vehicle,television,watch},env/{helpers,tags},palette,router,typography,utils}

```

The `mkdir` command above will create all the folders necessary for you to start working with Intrinsic Web Design {link here}. This toucaan folder will contain _all_ the css needed for your application's frontends.
