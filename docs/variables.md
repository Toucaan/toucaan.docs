# Utility Variables

Toucaan uses a number of utility variables that enable _deterministic_ control over UX/UI. The word deterministic here means applying styles without approximation about how the browser window would scale. 

The deterministic approach, for example, compels having the knowledge of the length or height of the UI container (the length of scroll) beforehand in multiples of the ICBâ€“the Initial Containing Block. It also compels understanding of how types would scale within a component _without triggering a reflow_.
 
##### Example:
The custom property `--fs` for `font-size` discussed in the [last chapter](./typography.md) is an example of utility variable.

To put it in simple terms, a styling layer can "belong to" the device _only_ when the kind of device and its underlying capabilities are known ahead of the render.

The problem of utility-driven css frameworks is the prescriptive nature of design comes along with the framework.

Meaning, all websites that use a particular framework look the same.
