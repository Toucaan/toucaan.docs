# Utility Variables

Toucaan uses a number of utility variables that enable _deterministic_ control over UX/UI. 

The word deterministic here means applying style without guesswork or assumptions about the browser window. The deterministic approach, for example, compels evaluation of the size of the UI container beforehand (in multiples of ICBâ€“the Initial Containing Block or the viewport within fold). To put it in intrinsic terms, a styling layer can "belong to" the device it is on _only_ when the kind of device it is on and its underlying capabilities are known.
