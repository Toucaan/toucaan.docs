# Introduction
Toucaan makes it possible to create "app-like" layouts for mobile and desktop apps using plain old HTML and CSS. This is the central theme of [Intrinsic Design](https://toucaan.com/blog/intrinsic-design). It enables the developer to create user-interfaces that "belong to" a device, and that often leads to mobile layouts that are closer to the design language of native apps than anything else. 

### App Workflow

A simple workflow with a minimum set of features is the way to go.
