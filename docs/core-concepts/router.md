# The CSS Router

Toucaan uses a simple CSS router to prioritize and load the correct stylesheet for a given _class of device_. 

To set it up, copy the following two files along with their contents in the `router` folder of our [repository](https://github.com/Toucaan/toucaan/tree/master/toucaan/router) on GitHub into the `toucaan/router` folder of your project. 

These two:

2. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Toucaan/toucaan/master/toucaan/router/landscape.css

Reader is recommended to spend some time and review the CSS level 4 media queries.
