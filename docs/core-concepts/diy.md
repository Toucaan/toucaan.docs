# DIY Framework

Let us **create a new folder** named `toucaan` somewhere in your project using the following command: 

```bash title="Setup:"
cd ./somewhere/in/your/project/

mkdir -p toucaan/{accessibility,app/{desktop,mobile,tablet,vehicle,television,watch},env/{helpers,tags},palette,router,typography,utils}

```

The `mkdir` command above will create all the folders necessary for you to start working with [intrinsic design](https://toucaan.com). These folders will carry ALL THE CSS necessary for your application's **multiple frontends**.
