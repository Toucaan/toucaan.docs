# 1. What is Intrinsic Design?

Intrinsic in the context of **application design** implies getting to an experience that _belongs to the device_. 


This term was coined by the one and only [Jen Simmons](https://twitter.com/jensimmons) while working at Mozilla on flex and grid-based layouts, but a curious mind could easily hop layout structures and go in the direction of exploring what belongs and what doesn't on a given medium for a whole lot of other design vocabulary. This is how Toucaan came about to be.

### How is it different from Responsive Design?

One way to visualize the difference between responsive and intrinsic design is to consider the differences between a native mobile app and mobile web. A native app often feels more natural to use on the phone because its overall layout, design language, and often performance belongs to a phone. Whereas mobile web design is more likely going to be a squished version of the desktop layout tucked away under a hamburger menu.
