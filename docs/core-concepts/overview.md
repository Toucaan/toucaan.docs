# General Overview

Toucaan is an intrinsic, mutative, and deterministic approach to styling websites and native mobile apps built using the web-stack. 
It also aids in support for the new devices according to the [new landscape of the web](https://bubblin.io/blog/the-new-landscape-of-the-web) and mobile apps.

> Toucaan is a stack-agnostic vanilla styling framework. 

Look at the Architecture of Toucaan in the [next chapter](architecture.md).
