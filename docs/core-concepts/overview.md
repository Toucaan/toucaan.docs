# 1. General Overview

Toucaan is a stack-agnostic vanilla styling framework. It can be used with any web development framework of your choice without having it tied to a specific package manager (like `npm`) of your favorite language.

Toucaan is **intrinsic, mutative, and deterministic** in nature, meaning:

1. _It helps you implement UX/UI using the intrinsic qualities of the medium._
2. _It lets you customize the framework defaults starting from vendor normalization and upwards._
3. _It affords deterministic control over UX/UI instead of an assumptive or approximated one._

Toucaan is a great way to organize your application css and add support for [the new kind of devices on the web](https://bubblin.io/blog/the-new-landscape-of-the-web).

Take a look at the Architecture of Toucaan in the [next chapter](architecture.md).
