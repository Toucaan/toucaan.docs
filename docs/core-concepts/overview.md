# 1. General Overview

Toucaan is a stack-agnostic vanilla styling framework. It is an _intrinsic, mutative, and deterministic_ approach to styling websites and mobile apps built with the web-stack. 

Meaning, Toucaan:

1. helps you implement UX/UI using the intrinsic capabilities of the medium.
2. lets you customize the framework defaults from vendor normalization and upwards.
3. takes a deterministic approach towards UX/UI instead of being assumptive about the behavior and the physicality of the browser window.



Toucaan also aids in adding support for the [new kind of devices on the web](https://bubblin.io/blog/the-new-landscape-of-the-web).



Look at the Architecture of Toucaan in the [next chapter](architecture.md).
