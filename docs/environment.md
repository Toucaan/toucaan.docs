# Environment Variables

Sprinkling css into an app is much like setting up the Environment Variables for your app to render correctly on the client side. While it may be a powerful thing for a developer to engage with the vast library of css properties and resources, it also a formidable task given the sheer number of options at hand to manage.

Toucaan makes it really easy to organize and manage the environment.

Break down your default styling strategy into smaller device-compatible units that are uniquely configurable. For example, handling the notch on a few common smart phones isn't a concern for the desktop css. 

Decide on a color palette, choose the right typefaces or host a font-family yourself, typeset with a few sane initial defaults, paint a selection or inactive state colorâ€“there are so many css configurations possible! 

Toucaan's [submodule](https://github.com/Toucaan/toucaan) comes with thoroughly in-line documented code which will help you make your app speak of your brand. 


> Tip: Start small with just desktop and mobile support initially. Take it further once you're comfortable and at pace for the remaining scope.
