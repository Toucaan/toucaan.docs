# Environment Variables

Sprinkling css into an app is much like setting up the Environment Variables for your app to render correctly on the client side. It is quite a powerful thing, but also formidable given the sheer number of options at hand to manage.

Decide a color palette, choose the right typefaces or host a font-family, apply a few sane initial defaults to your typesets, paint a selection or inactive state color. There are so many things that will make your app speak of your brand, and yet there is always the new stuff that you can do with css additionally. 

Toucaan makes it really easy to organize and manage the environment.

> Tip: Start small with just desktop and mobile support initially. Take it further once you're comfortable and at pace for the remaining scope.
