# Introduction
Toucaan allows implementation of intrinsic app design using the web stack.


There are several differences between a responsive designed website and a true mobile app. Not to mention the difference in performance due to modules that take advantage of the low-level system or simply an offline experience.

## I. Browser UI

The first difference that comes to mind is the lack of browser UI. 
 
Obviously, ðŸ™‚. 
 
Apps generally do not sport a url bar (unless the app is a browser itself!), and the lack of control elements like the back or forward buttons and the url box make for a clean surface to work with. If one removed the browser UI from the viewport, turns out that there would be literally zero difference between the real estates that are available to mobile apps and the web. Window = canvas.

Sure, with web apps there will be network requests to complete before a page is fully rendered for the user to interact with, but from a standpoint of interface (UI) or simply static design, there is absolutely no difference between the stage that is available to mobile apps or the web. The number of pixels to draw on the screen is equal for both the web and the native. 

## II. Application Design
The second difference between a responsively designed website and a mobile app is in the idea of design itself. Mobile apps generally do not have a header or footer with links to other pages or screens, for example. 

The vocabulary of scrolling vs. panning and numerous other finer bits that add to the overall.

## III. Performative Upgrades

Network requests can be done away with using a high resolution serviceworker. 

And now we are talking about literally no difference between a webapp written in php or rails or node and a mobile app written in swift. Both applications can perform really well and will be indistinguishable from each other as long as the design and experience of the webapp is kept first class. Only in very extreme applications, like gaming or binary asset processing would the performance feel a pressure, but there too a web-based application using webassembly could dent the appeal of going native.

Container and stack aside, there are several other places where responsive web design and mobile UI do not exactly reconcile. The following list enumerates some of those differences and is followed by our recommendations on intrinsic app design so as to have the best outcome with your Red Goose app.
